# Project-Amazon-Warehouse-Distribution-Regions

The goal of this project is to have a starting place for analyzing if Amazon warehouses are too close to each other.  

Potential next steps after generating the plotly map:
<ul>
  <li>Determine if warehouses were located close to each other to distribute storage capacity across locations to better serve a common region or not.</li>
  <li>Assuming existing warehouses are all strategically located, what customers should we focus on serving next?</li>
</ul>
